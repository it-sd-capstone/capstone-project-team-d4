Pitch: Dungeons and Dragons(DND) can sometimes feel like it has a high barrier to entry. With it's rules, dice, and freedom 
of creative expression. But with this website, Team D4's, you can ease into learning with the basic tools
of DND. We have built in a encounter simulation page,  a character creator, and dice roller page to help new players navigate
the unknown landscape of how DND could be played. There are many ways to play DND, and we did our best to make it more
accessible to enter into the world of imagination that is Dungeons And Dragons.
